## Project Summary

This project implements a **read-only WebUI page** in Chromium (chrome://tab-strip-internals) that provides a live, structured visualization of the **tabstrip model**, including tab groups, selection state, and session-restore metadata.

The WebUI helps developers debug and inspect complex tab behaviors by exposing internal C++ model data from the TabStripModel, TabRestore Service, and Session Service through a **Mojo interface** and rendering it in a **TypeScript-based frontend**.

### Key Features
- Real-time updates of the tabstrip model  
- Collapsible tree view showing tabs, groups, and session data  
- Raw data toggle for deep inspection  
- Strictly **read-only** access to maintain browser safety

## Goals

- Create a WebUI chrome page similar to chrome://tab-search.top-chrome/  
- Visualize the tabstrip model as a hierarchical tree  
- Display group and selection model metadata  
- Integrate session information from session restore  
- Ensure complete read-only access (no modification actions)

## Non-Goals

- Performing any state-changing actions from the WebUI  
- Fixing existing tabstrip/session bugs (debug-only focus)
